# UtilitsForBioinfApplication 

## Discription
Utilities for Bioinformatics Application is a Python package that provides tools for working with biological sequences (DNA, RNA, and amino acids) and filtering FASTQ files. The package consists of the following components:

**Classes for Biological Sequences:**

- `BiologicalSequence`: Abstract base class defining the interface for biological sequences.

- `NucleicAcidSequence:` Base class for nucleic acid sequences (DNA and RNA). Provides methods for:

     - `complement`: Returns the complementary sequence.
  
     - `reverse`: Returns the reversed sequence.
  
     - `reverse_complement`: Returns the reverse complement of the sequence.

- `DNASequence`: Class for DNA sequences with methods for transcription. Adds a method:

     - `transcribe`: Transcribes DNA to RNA.

- `RNASequence`: Class for RNA sequences. Uses RNA-specific complement rules.

- `AminoAcidSequence`: Class for amino acid sequences with methods for calculating molecular weight. Provides a method:

     - `molecular_weight`: Calculates the molecular weight of the amino acid sequence.
      
For all types of sequences you can also check its length, estract an element by index or a slice from input string and check if the string contains non-NA or non-aa characters.

**Functions for FASTQ Filtering:**

`filter_fastq`: Filters sequences in a FASTQ file based on:

   - GC content: Specified as a tuple (min_gc, max_gc) or a single value (upper bound). If not specified is `(0, 100)` by default;

   - Length: Specified as a tuple (min_length, max_length) or a single value (upper bound). If not specified is `(0, 2**32)` by default;

   - Quality: Minimum quality score threshold. If not specified is `0` by default;

Also prvides:

 - Detailed logging: Comprehensive log file with filtering statistics
 - Input validation: Checks for correct FASTQ format
 - Debug output: Shows filtering parameters for troubleshooting

**convert_multiline_fasta_to_oneline** works with multiline FASTA-files and converts them to oneline.

**parse_blast_output** works with BLAST search output and selects names of proteins with significant alignments.

## Input and output format

For **UtilsforBioinfApplication_OOP**:

**Input:** sequences provided as strings via object initialization.

*Input example:* 

`dna = DNASequence("ATGC")`

`print(dna.complement())`

**Output:** methods return strings or lists of strings, depending on the operation.

*Output example:* `Output: TACG` 

For **FASTQ_filtr**:

**Filtering Options:** five arguments:
`input_fastq` -  Path to the input FASTQ file;

`output_fastq` - Path to the output FASTQ file;

`--gc-bounds MIN MAX` - a tuple of lower and upper bounds for gc-content in provided sequences or an int - only upper bound;

`--length-bounds MIN MAX` - a tuple of lower and upper bounds for length of provided sequences or an int - only upper bound;

`--quality` - an int - an upper bound for quality of reads for provided sequences;

`--log` - Path to log file (default: fastq_filter.log).

*Usage:* `python fastq_filter.py -i INPUT.FASTQ -o OUTPUT.FASTQ [OPTIONS]`

**Output:** 
- FASTQ-file in .fastq format with sequences that passed by GC-content, length and read quality. If no reads passed, empty file will be returned;
- Log file (fastq_filter.log by default) with:
     - Input parameters
     - Filtering statistics (total reads, passed/failed counts)
     - First 5 passed reads details (ID, length, GC%, min quality)
     - Error messages if any occur

For **convert_multiline_fasta_to_oneline**:

**Input:** two arguments
`input_fasta` - multiline FASTA file;
`output_fasta` - empty file to write sequences in. Is optional, if not provided, `input_fasta` is transformed.

*Input format example:*
`>5S_rRNA::NODE_272_length_223_cov_0.720238:18-129(+)
ACGGCCATAGGA
CTTTGAAA`

**Output:** FASTA-file.

*Output format example:* 
`>5S_rRNA::NODE_272_length_223_cov_0.720238:18-129(+)
ACGGCCATAGGACTTTGAAA`

For **parse_blast_output**:

**Input:** two arguments:
`input_file` - .txt file with BLAST search results;
`output_file` - empty file to write sequences in.

*Output:** .txt file with alphabetically ordered list of proteins with significant alignments.

*Output format example:* 
`'conjugal transfer protein TraA [Enterobacteriaceae]
 'conjugal transfer protein TraC [Enterobacteriaceae]
 'DinI-like family protein [Escherichia coli]`

### FASTQ-filtrator additional features

**Debugging**

The log file includes detailed information for troubleshooting:

 - Parameters of first 20 reads;
 - Reason for filtering failure for each read;
 - Summary statistics showing how many reads failed each filter.

**Error Handling**

The tool validates:

 - Input file exists and is in FASTQ format;

 - GC bounds are between 0 and 100;

 - Minimum length â‰¤ maximum length;

 - Output directory is writable.

**Testing**

Unit tests are available to verify functionality:

  - Quality score filtering;

  - Length filtering;

  - GC content filtering;

  - File operations;

  - Error handling.

Run tests with: `pytest test_fastq_filter.py` in bash.

**Dependencies**

  - Python 3.6+

  - Biopython

  - Loguru (for logging)

  - pytest (for testing)




## Limitations
**UtilsforBioinfApplication_OOP** can only work with one typa of NA at a time, you can not provide both in one run. It will also not accept mixed sequences with both 'U' and 'T' present.

**parse_blast_output** is not immune to BLAST output modifications. Strings in output may include additional information or syntax defects.
